Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in individualized financial plans for its customers, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They sought Global Rain’s expertise to enhance the security of their web application, specifically to add a file verification step for secure communications and ensure the safe transfer of client data and financial information. 


What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I did well utilizing static testing of potential vulnerabilities. Secure code is important as it protects not only yourself from security risks but others who might suffer as a result. Without secure code a company's reputation would be negatively affected as they would not be trusted by their customers to keep their information secure.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I found the dependancy check tool to be incredibly helpful as it allowed me to see what vulnerabilities were being detected in a way that didn't require me to manually check by hand every single dependency.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I manually checked to make sure there were no errors or issues and also reran the depenancy check tool to make sure there weren't additional vulnerabilities detected.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Once again I think the dependency check tool, I didn't even know a tool like that existed prior to this class so knowing about it will make things easier if I ever find it neccessary going forward. 

For Future Employers I'd show them my example of Project 1 where I did a mananual review of the code provided to me to indentify vulernabilities and provide advice on how to fix them.
